                                               Day 3: API Integration and Data Migration
  Objective:
  Day 3 aimed to integrate an external API into Sanity CMS and migrate its data to build a dynamic and functional marketplace backend. The tasks involved testing API endpoints
  , transforming data, making schema adjustments, and ensuring the successful rendering of data in the frontend.

  Steps Performed :

  1. Understanding the API
  . API URL: https://next-ecommerce-template-4.vercel.app/api/product

  . API Purpose: Provided product details such as name, category, price, images, and other metadata.

  . Validation: API responses were tested using Postman to ensure data integrity and endpoint reliability.

2. Setting Up the Backend
  . Tools Used:
  . axios for making API requests.

  . @sanity/client for interacting with Sanity CMS.

  . dotenv for managing environment variables securely.

  . Node.js for running the script.

3. Sanity Schema Adjustments

 . Used pre-existing schemas provided during the hackathon project setup.

 . Key fields in the product schema:

 . Name: string

 . Category: reference to a category schema.

 . Image: Asset field storing uploaded images.

. Other Metadata: Price, description, discount percentage, and stock levels.

4. Data Migration

Process:

1. Data Fetching: Used axios to fetch product data from the API.

2, Image Uploads: Images were uploaded to Sanity CMS using its asset manager.

3. Data Transformation: API data was mapped to match the structure of the Sanity schema.

4. Data Import: Data was inserted into Sanity CMS using the client.create method.

. Error Handling:

  . Errors during image upload or data import were caught using try-catch blocks.

  . Debugging logs were implemented for traceability.

5. Frontend Integration

Integrated Sanity CMS with the frontend project.

 . Utilized backend functions to fetch data:

 . getAllProducts: Fetches all products.

 . getFeaturedProducts: Fetches featured items.

 . getProductBySlug: Retrieves details for a specific product.

                                                     Challenges and Solutions

. Image Upload Failures:

   Challenge: Some image URLs were broken or inaccessible.

   Solution: Added error handling to skip problematic URLs and log errors.

. Schema Mapping Issues:

   Challenge: Mismatches between API data and Sanity schema fields.

  Solution: Applied transformations to map API fields to the Sanity schema.

. API Rate Limits:

   Challenge: API calls were throttled during bulk data migration.

   Solution: Added delays between requests to avoid hitting rate limits.

                                                     Results

Backend Setup: Successfully integrated Sanity CMS with the frontend project.

Data Migration: Imported all products, including images and metadata, into Sanity CMS.

Frontend Rendering: Verified data rendering and interactivity in the frontend.

Future Improvements

Automate schema validation to preempt field mismatches.

Enhance logging for better traceability during data migration.

Explore real-time syncing between external APIs and Sanity CMS using webhooks.

Conclusion

Day 3 successfully showcased the integration of external API data into Sanity CMS. The robust migration process ensured data accuracy, prepared the system for scalability, and enabled dynamic frontend functionality.
